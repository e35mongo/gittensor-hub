// Per-repo "maintainer performance" scorecard, computed from the densely-
// populated issue/PR timestamps the poller caches (created_at / merged_at /
// closed_at). We deliberately do NOT lean on `issue_comments` for a time-to-
// first-response figure: that table is sparse (only a few repos have comment
// data), so a comment-derived metric would silently read as "instant" for every
// repo we haven't fetched comments for. The timestamp metrics below exist for
// every tracked repo.
//
// Scope: figures are restricted to **registered Gittensor miners' work** when a
// miner login set is supplied — the local `pulls`/`issues` tables hold every
// GitHub contributor, but only miner PRs/issues are relevant to the subnet. A
// repo with `issueDiscoveryShare > 0` rewards miners for *finding* issues, so
// the issue-responsiveness figures (over miner-opened issues) are first-class
// there, not just PR review speed.
//
// The figures answer "how well is this repo's maintainer serving miners?":
//   • Review speed   — how fast miner PRs get merged (the headline).
//   • Throughput      — how much miner work gets merged / closed.
//   • Backlog health  — how much miner work is piling up and how old it is.
